## Title
Differential Gene Expression in TCGA within Stage A Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia comparing Progression and Stable using DeSEQ2
## Author

## Overview of project
I will identify differentially expressed genes between Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia for progression and stable patients. 
This analysis will utilize the package DeSEQ2 and follow the specific vignette: http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html. For this analysis, I'll use the TCGA cohort and have identified 205 Ht-seq counts files for tumors that fit within my cohort with 48 progression patients and 157 stable patients. Within the analysis, I will control for race, ethnicity, and gender.
