## Section 1: Update
* I made volcano plot, MA-plot, Plot counts, hotmaps, and PCA plot.
* My volcano plot：

* My MA-plot：

* My Plot counts：
https://github.com/kechiristywang/final_project_of_Ke_Wang/blob/1221b4ec27b12579513bfa2a49b406231cbbeeed/scripts/Plot_counts.png
* My hotmaps：

* My PCA plot：
https://github.com/kechiristywang/final_project_of_Ke_Wang/blob/1221b4ec27b12579513bfa2a49b406231cbbeeed/scripts/PCA%20plot.png


## Section 2: Next Steps
* I will make more plots based on my data. These plots will show the donor's gene based on disease stats, age, and gender.

## Section 3: Data 
Not due by Milestone 1, but I'll address.
* My github will not hold my data about gene_id and Htseq_count. I will put my data in a shared GoogleDrive folder as a tar/zip file called finalproject.tar.gz which upon untaring with tar -xvzf finalproject.tar.gz will create a folder called data that contains all my data in a way that my script can operate off of.  This section will create a link that shared dataset.


## Section 4: Known Issues
* Known issues: My current problem is that there is no correspondence between gene_names and gene_id. The parameters of the volcano map I drew need to be based on.
