## Section 1: Update

* I made volcano plot, MA-plot, Plot counts, hotmaps, and PCA plot.

* My MA-plot：

* My Plot counts：

* My effects of transformations on the variance.

* My PCA plot：

## Section 2: Next Steps
* I need to tidy up my final510.Rmd file. 
* I need to run rlog() again. Because of the large amount of data, the rlog() function takes a lot of time to run.


## Section 3: Data 
Not due by Milestone 2, but I'll address.
* My github will not hold my data about gene_id and Htseq_count. I will put my data in a shared GoogleDrive folder as a tar/zip file called finalproject.tar.gz which upon untaring with tar -xvzf finalproject.tar.gz will create a folder called data that contains all my data in a way that my script can operate off of.  This section will create a link that shared dataset.


## Section 4: Known Issues
* Part of the code is not successful, but it does not affect the plots. Due to the large amount of data, some functions (like rlog()) take a long time to run. I will try to run the unfinished code again.
* There is no sufficient explanation in the code file now. I need to integrate the code and explain it in detail.
* Some pictures are not beautiful enough. I need to change the markers of some pictures to make the coordinates of the pictures look concise.
