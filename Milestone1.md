## Section 1: Update
* I finished the basic data processing with Excel and Rstudio, and I imported the data into the DeSEQ2 for calculation. According to the calculation results, I drew a volcano plot with labels. 
* I uploaded the files which are needed in Rstudio to the scripts folder. Note: the gene file too big to load on the Github, so I will create a GoogleDrive to load the file.



## Section 2: Next Steps
* I will make more plots based on my data. These plots will show the donor's gene based on disease stats, age, and gender.

## Section 3: Data.  Not due by Milestone 1, but I'll address.
* My github will not hold my data about gene_id and Htseq_count. I will put my data in a shared GoogleDrive folder as a tar/zip file called finalproject.tar.gz which upon untaring with tar -xvzf finalproject.tar.gz will create a folder called data that contains all my data in a way that my script can operate off of.  This section will create a link that shared dataset.


## Section 4: Known Issues. 
* Known issues: My current problem is that there is no correspondence between gene_names and gene_id. The parameters of the volcano map I drew need to be based on.
