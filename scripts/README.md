# How to use this folder

## Rmd

* I have three Rmd files in total. The order of use is step 1 to step 2 to step 3. The three files can be used separately. All package installation methods are in step 1. Files and Rmd files in the same folder can be run directly, otherwise you need to modify the file path.

## Files

* There are two original files in total, seq.tsv and donor.csv. Other files are part of result. They all in final_project_of_Ke_Wang/scripts/Data.
* One of the original files cannot be uploaded to Github, so I created a Google Drive to store all the files.
